        <h1><u>What are DDOS Attacks?</u></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p> DDOS attacks are the malicious attempts to disrupt the normal function of a target computer​</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> It generates the more traffic to the server by sending the multiple bot or fake requests.​ ​</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> These attacks can cause serious damage to the performance and security of online services​ ​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Due to these attacks the system functionality will get struck and not able to give access to the
                    original users.​ ​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>So by using this DDOS technique we can find or detect the fake users and original users​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p> In a Distributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attack, an attacker uses multiple sources to orchestrate an
                    attack against a target.​​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>These sources can include distributed groups of malware infected computers, routers, IoT devices, and
                    other endpoints. ​​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a distributed , co-ordinated attack on the
                    availability of services of a host server (application server, storage, database Server, or DNS
                    server) or network resource, launched indirectly through many compromised systems called botnets on
                    the Internet​​</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>DDOS attacks can range from simple network attacks to all cloud resources attacks​​</p>
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h1><u>System Analysis</u></h1>
        <h2>Exesting System</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>

                    Considering how hackers are using very sophisticated attacking tools and methods to intrude and
                    disrupt systems, the road ahead for the next generation of intrusion detection system is very
                    challenging and need a collective effort.​

            <li>
                <p> While the important aspect of these detection schemes is to defend itself from attacks, those
                    traditional intrusion detection systems have not adapted to new technological paradigms like mobile
                    and wireless networks​

            <li>
                <p> Different schemes have been used with these detection mechanisms. The following table discusses the
                    advantages and disadvantages of different detection schemes ​</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1><u>Disadvantages of Exesting system</u></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>​

                    Different types of DDoS detection methods have been proposed based on different architectures
                    namely, victim-end, source-end, and in-network​
            <li>
                <p>
                    These detection systems have not adapted to new technologies like mobile and wireless networks​</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1><u>Proposed System</u></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>We propose a hybrid model by noticing that two approaches the covariance matrix based and the
                    entropy-based system – are heuristically similar in that both classify a DDoS attack via measuring
                    heightened dependency in the data.​</p>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h1><u>Advantages of proposed System</u></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>This work would help security researchers to deal with the DDoS differently as compared to the
                    treatment given while considering traditional IT infrastructure.​
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> We introduce DDOS attack scenario in infrastructure clouds and identify how various elements of
                    cloud computing are affected by DDOS attacks.​
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Based on developed taxonomy , we identify weaknesses in the state-of-the-art solution space leading
                    to future research directions. ​</p>
            </li>
